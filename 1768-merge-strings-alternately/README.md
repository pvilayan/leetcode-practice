# LeetCode Problem: Merge Strings Alternately (Problem 1768)

## üìù Problem Description

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, merge them by alternating characters from each string. Start with the first character of `word1`, then the first character of `word2`, and so on. If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters to the end of the merged string.

---

## ‚ùó My Initial Solution (Using `vector<char>`)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<char> merged_total;
        int min_length = min(word1.length(), word2.length());

        // Alternating characters
        for (int i = 0; i < min_length; i++) {
            merged_total.push_back(word1[i]);
            merged_total.push_back(word2[i]);
        }

        // Remaining characters from word1
        for (int i = min_length; i < word1.length(); i++) {
            merged_total.push_back(word1[i]);
        }

        // Remaining characters from word2
        for (int i = min_length; i < word2.length(); i++) {
            merged_total.push_back(word2[i]);
        }

        // Convert to string and return
        string result(merged_total.begin(), merged_total.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

‚ùå Issues in Early Versions
Used a global vector which persisted across test cases in LeetCode.

Overused multiple vectors (merged1, merged2) when only one was needed.

Incorrect indexing with i + 2 caused skipped or out-of-bound characters.

Redundant length checks inside the loop ‚Äî should have been handled after the main merging.

‚úÖ Final Optimized Solution (Using string)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result;
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        // Loop until both strings are fully processed
        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length()) result += word1[i++];
            if (j < word2.length()) result += word2[j++];
        }

        return result;
    }
};
‚úÖ Why the Optimized Version is Better
No extra memory used for vectors ‚Äî just one string result.

Handles unequal string lengths smoothly with simple conditionals.

Shorter, cleaner, and easier to read.

Avoids scope or memory issues common with global vectors in LeetCode.

# üß† Takeaway
When solving string manipulation problems:

Favor simplicity when possible.

Avoid global variables in online judges like LeetCode.

Think about how the loop will behave with different input lengths.

üìö Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n = word1.length() and m = word2.length()

Space Complexity: O(n + m) for the result string
